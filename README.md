## NOTES ##

### VANCOUVER 
Thanks to Justin McElroy ([@j_mcelroy](https://twitter.com/j_mcelroy)) for (manually!!!) geolocating Vancouver polling stations the night poll-level results were released. 

NOTE: There are multiple division IDs associated with three polling stations in Vancouver:
 * Britannia Community Services Centre 
 * Marpole
 * RayCam Co

 You will need to filter/tally results associated with duplicate polling stations accordingly.

### SURREY
Vote results from [this HTML page](https://apps.surrey.ca/2022Results/Election%20Results%20per%20Voting%20Opportunity.html) have been converted to csv.

Still waiting on geolocation data for Surrey polling stations.
